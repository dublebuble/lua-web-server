== Introduction ==

This is a experimental project made to see if I could convert a web server implementation I saw written in Ruby to Lua.

As of version 0.1, it only supports the serving of HTML documents.

==Prerequisties==

This web server requires the Lua interpreter and LuaSocket.

==Installing web server== 

You will need to install the Lua interpreter and/or LuaSocket in a location where LuaSocket is accessible by the Lua interpreter.

Make sure that the path to the intepreter ("lua") is in your operating system's PATH variable or you will have to type in the shell or change the _webs_ script to point to the lua interpreter and run the web server like so:

{{{
/path/to/lua webserver.lua
}}}
